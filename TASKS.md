#Tasks To Accomplish

## Language Features

- Indirect addressing or pointer addressing
- Optimize memory usage and detect availability of RAM
- User-defined blocks/functions
- Data flow analysis for reusing existing scratch memory space
- Improve error messages

## Code Generation Features

- String tables (read-only data)
- ASCII conversion of numbers and alphabets
- Sleep/Wake-up of processor
- EEPROM read/write and storage of large data blobs such as music files or
  images
- Verify PWM implementation on Oscilloscope - (example is verified)
- UART
- I2C
- SPI
- USB
- Ethernet
- Watchdog Timer
- Power management
- Interrupt on Change for reads (Event based reading)
- Code protection features if allowed by chip
- Oscillator selection and modification
- Usage of Comparators with examples
- 16-bit arithmetic
- fixed-point arithmetic

## Examples

- XOR encoding of data
- Running a Motor using VIC and PWM capabilities
- Exchanging data with a desktop OS using UART
- Extracting firmware from monitor VGA cable using I2C
- An example of reading data from SPI bus
- An example of building a low speed USB device
- An example of a 10-BaseT Ethernet
- Examples for power management, sleep/wake-up features
- Examples for all other chip features like:
    - Comparators
    - 16-bit Timers
    - Oscillators
    - EEPROM read/write/storage
